== Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Sign off commits (`git commit -s`)
4. Submit a pull request

== Development Setup

[source,bash]
----
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/anvomidav-playground.git
cd anvomidav-playground

# Install dependencies (Deno required per RSR)
deno task dev

# Run tests
just test

# Run formal verification
just verify
----

== Commit Guidelines

* Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
* Sign all commits (DCO required)
* Atomic, focused commits

== Code Style

* ReScript for application logic (per RSR Language Policy)
* Deno for runtime (not Node/npm/bun per RSR)
* Descriptive variable names
* Full formal specifications for all timing-critical code

== Formal Verification Guidelines

When working with verified code:

* All timing bounds must be formally specified
* WCET analysis required for all tasks
* Schedulability must be proven
* Proofs must be machine-checkable

== Testing

[source,bash]
----
# Run all tests
just test

# Run formal verification
just verify

# Analyze WCET
just wcet-analysis

# Check schedulability
just schedulability
